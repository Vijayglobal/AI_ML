Purpose: Black-Box Optimisation of eight unknown functions using surrogate modelling.

Inputs: Continuous vectors (2D–8D) representing candidate parameter configurations.

Outputs: Real-valued function responses (objective to be maximised).

Process: Iterative surrogate modelling → Expected Improvement calculation → new query proposal.
